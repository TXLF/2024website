Major Hayden is a senior principal software engineer at Red Hat working on
scaling systems, processes, and teams. His most recent project was the
Continuous Kernel Integration Project (CKI) which provides timely CI for
upstream Linux kernel trees and internal kernels at Red Hat. He contributes to
the Fedora Project and was a contributor to OpenStack at Rackspace.

In his spare time, he's on the air as an amateur radio operator (W5WUT) and on
the trails as a novice overlander. Major also operates the incredibly popular
(and slightly useless) icanhazip.com. You can read his blog at:
