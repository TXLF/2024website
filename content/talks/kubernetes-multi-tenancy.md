This workshop will guide you through setting up a multi-tenant Kubernetes
cluster to ensure that tenants are securely isolated while at the same time
making sure they have sufficient autonomy within their environment. This
workshop includes topics like network isolation, RBAC, admission control, fair
use of compute resources, storage isolation, and more. Additionally, the talk
will cover technologies like vCluster and how to configure them to provision
more than just namespaces to tenants for control plane isolation.
